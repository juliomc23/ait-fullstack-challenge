This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can enter to the page with this credentials {

- email: admin@admin.es,
- password: admin_123456
  }.

If you try other credentials it will not let you go in

You can't access protected pages if your are not registered, because a middleware is protecting it

## Functionality of the app

- You can see gifs
- You can see only one gif
- And you can search gifs
